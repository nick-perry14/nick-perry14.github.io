# Portfolio

Attached below are some of the projects that I have completed as a part of my course work at [Miami University](/university).  
* [Web Applications Programming Final](cse383final) - This project was a weather dashboard written in HTML, Bootstrap, Ajax, JQuery, PHP, and CSS that interacted with external APIs and an internal database to display and store weather information about any location. 
* [SQL-Air](cse381-sqlair) - Project completed for Systems II class that was a C++ interface for a CSV backed SQL database.  The C++ program managed the storing, reading, and executing of SQL queries on a CSV backend.
* [Project Trump](cse201-projecttrump) - Project completed for Introduction to Software Engineering.  This project was an applications directory program that contained both integrated applications and links to other applications with user account management.
