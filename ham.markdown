## QSLs

As I am a (poor) student with not a lot of time on my hand, I request QSLs be in the form of EQSLs.  They are easier to track, and I do not have to pay for postage for return QSLs.  Thank You!

## WB8BIU Significance

WB8BIU was issued to my grandfather, Clifford "Denny" Perry.  For as long as I could remember, Denny had his giant antenna outside of his house, and had his HAM setup in his basement.  I remember him taking me to some HAM events to help with parking and such in West Chester, Ohio.  My grandfather passed away on May 24, 2020.  Following his death, I decided to take on his callsign as HAM radio was a large part of his life.
